Add proposal system: pre-tasks that auto-promote via collective reinforcement. Agents call `task_propose` to surface a candidate improvement; other agents call `task_reinforce` (kind `explicit` or `rediscovered`), and PostToolUse adds weak `adjacent` reinforcement whenever an edit touches a file listed in a pending proposal's `touches_files`. Total decayed strength (1-hour half-life, weights 1.0 / 0.7 / 0.3 by kind) is recomputed on every read; when it crosses `PROMOTION_THRESHOLD` (2.5), the proposal is auto-promoted to a real `TaskThread` on a synthetic branch `{branch}/proposal-{id}`. The new `task_foraging_report` MCP tool lists pending (above the 0.3 noise floor) and promoted proposals; `SessionStart` surfaces the same report in-preface. Schema bumped 4 → 5: adds `proposals` and `proposal_reinforcements`.
